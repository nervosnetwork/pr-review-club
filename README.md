# PR Review Club

As most reviewers have their own jobs, the review process can take a long time. The Review Club helps to assign reviewers to PRs which have no enough attentions.


## The Process

- PR authors submit PRs to the club.
- Club maintainers will review the list and assign reviewers.

### For PR Author

Add the PR to the project [PR Review Club](https://github.com/orgs/nervosnetwork/projects/28). Contributors also can ask repository maintainers to add it.

## For Reviewers

There are two kinds of reviewers:

- owners: who are able to review the PR thoroughly
- watchers: who are interested

Please send a PR in this repository to add yourself to the list of reviewers for different projects.

If you don't want to be listed as reviewers for a project, but are interested in some PRs, you can either add yourself in the PR reviewers list to become an owner, or give the eyes (:eyes:) reactions to the PR to become a watcher.

### For Club Maintainers

- Notify review candidates of PRs in the `ðŸ†• New` column on Wednsday 3AM UTC by creating a discussion thread.
    - The GitHub Action [Start Discussion](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/pr-review-club/actions/workflows/start-discussion.yml) will create the discussion thread on Wednsday. It is also possible to manually trigger the workflow.
- Discuss the reviewers assignment in the thread from Thusday 3AM UTC to Friday 3AM UTC.

### For Repository Maintainers
